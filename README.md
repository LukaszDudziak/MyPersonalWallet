# MyPersonalWallet
I was always a little bit obsessed with menaging my personal budget, firstly I was using just a paper and pen to write all my incomes and outgoings, it was simple, but not really effective. Then, I've made quite advanced MS Excel sheet, but still i was forced to carry all those checks in my pockets, and it wasn't as comfortable as it could be to use this sheet on smartphone. That's why I've started this project! For now it's just a concept, but I'm highly motivated to develop this concept to the working, and functional version.

For now I'm working on standard incomes/outgoings CRUD, but I've got a lot of ideas for this project, so wait for new commits, and more info :)
